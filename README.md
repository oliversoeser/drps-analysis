# drps-analysis

This is a data analysis project applying graph algorithms to data describing University of Edinburgh courses and the relationships between them.

The topological sort and connected components algorithms implemented in `graphs.py` are adapted from the pseudocode in Mary Cryan's [INF2-IADS](https://opencourse.inf.ed.ac.uk/inf2-iads) lectures.

The data is sourced from the University of Edinburgh's Degree Regulations and Programmes of Study ([DRPS](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/)) website. All DRPS data is Â© Copyright 2024 The University of Edinburgh.
